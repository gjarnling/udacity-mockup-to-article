# udacity-mockup-to-article
The second project in [Udacitys Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001) program called "Mockup to Article".

## Description
Replicate a design mockup of a blog post and translate it to [valid HTML](https://validator.w3.org/).

## Prerequisites
Being a mere 2.5 hours the course is a short introduction to HTML with a related problem set. Even so it covered a lot of important matters. Below is a short summary of the content; just be adviced that this in no way is a comprehensive or detailed explanation of the content covered.

## Solution
Used the appropriate HTML5 tags to structure the document and validated it in W3C Validator. You can view it [here](https://gjarnling.github.io/udacity-mockup-to-article/).

## Closure
The solution met the specifications.
